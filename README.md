Yes, it's possible that the wobbling issue is related to the PID controller. Wobbling or oscillations in the vehicle's behavior can be a result of improper tuning of the PID controller parameters. Here are a few considerations to troubleshoot and potentially address the wobbling issue:

Proportional Gain (K_P):

If the proportional gain is too high, it can lead to overshooting and oscillations. Try reducing the value of K_P and observe the response.
Integral Gain (K_I):

An excessively high integral gain can contribute to overshooting and oscillations. Gradually decrease the value of K_I to see if it helps.
Derivative Gain (K_D):

If the derivative gain is too high, it might amplify high-frequency noise, leading to instability. Consider reducing the value of K_D and observe the impact.
System Dynamics:

Consider the dynamics of your vehicle. If the vehicle has significant inertia or delays in its response, the PID controller may need adjustments to account for these characteristics.
Sampling Time (dt):

Ensure that the sampling time (dt) used in the PID controller matches the actual time between simulation steps. Mismatched sampling times can affect controller performance.
Initial Conditions:

Ensure that the initial conditions and state of the PID controller are appropriate for the starting state of your vehicle.
Other Control Parameters:

Check if other control parameters in your system, such as maximum throttle, maximum brake, and maximum steering, are within reasonable limits.
Feedback Loop:

Verify the feedback loop and the correctness of the error signal used by the PID controller.
Simulation Environment:

Consider checking if the wobbling issue persists under different conditions in your simulation environment.
Simulation Debugging:

Use debugging tools, visualizations, or logging to gain insights into the behavior of the PID controller and the vehicle dynamics.
Remember that tuning PID controllers often involves an iterative process of experimentation and observation. Make small adjustments to the parameters, test the system, and analyze the impact. It's essential to find a balance that provides stability and smooth control for your specific vehicle and scenario.
