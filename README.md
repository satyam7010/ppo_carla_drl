The termination of the run at intersections might be due to various reasons. Let's analyze the code to identify potential issues and propose improvements:

Waypoint Index Check: The termination condition involves checking whether self.current_waypoint_index is greater than or equal to the length of self.route_waypoints minus 2. This condition might be triggered when the vehicle reaches the last waypoints, which could include intersections. Make sure that the waypoints used in the simulation cover the entire desired route, including intersections.

python
Copy code
if self.current_waypoint_index >= len(self.route_waypoints) - 2:
    done = True
    self.fresh_start = True
    # ...
Intersection Handling: When approaching intersections, the code might be facing issues in determining the next waypoint correctly, leading to termination. Ensure that the waypoint calculation near intersections is accurate. Also, make sure that the waypoints are properly connected in the map.

python
Copy code
for x in range(self.total_distance):
    # ...
Traffic Light Handling: There's a section for handling traffic lights, but it might not be sufficient. Make sure that the logic for handling traffic lights is correct and does not inadvertently trigger termination.

python
Copy code
if self.vehicle.is_at_traffic_light():
    traffic_light = self.vehicle.get_traffic_light()
    if traffic_light.get_state() == carla.TrafficLightState.Red:
        traffic_light.set_state(carla.TrafficLightState.Green)
Observation Handling: Ensure that the observation space, especially the image observation (self.image_obs), is correctly captured at intersections. Check whether there's any issue with the camera sensor or its configuration.

python
Copy code
self.image_obs = self.camera_obj.front_camera.pop(-1)
Episode Time Termination: The code includes a termination condition based on the episode time. Ensure that the episode time condition is not accidentally triggering termination at intersections.

python
Copy code
elif self.episode_start_time + 10 < time.time() and self.velocity < 1.0:
    reward = -10
    done = True
General Exception Handling: The code includes a broad exception handling block. While it's good for catching unexpected errors, it might be hiding specific issues. It's recommended to log or print more specific error messages to aid in debugging.

After reviewing and addressing these points, you should have a clearer understanding of why the code might be terminating at intersections. If issues persist, consider adding additional debug prints or logging statements to trace the execution flow and identify the specific conditions triggering termination.
